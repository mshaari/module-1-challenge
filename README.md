# Module 1 Challenge - HTML CSS Git Code Refactor 

## Description

In this project, I refactored code from an existing HTML (index.html) and CSS (style.ccs) file to make it more accessible, polish the website itself by fixing mistakes, adding comments throughout the HTMl and CSS to make it clear what each secion does, consolidating the CSS properties, and altering the HTML to folow semantic structure.
